# Contact-Department-Flask-Server
Simple Flask Server for assigning contacts to a department.
It has many things that can be added, but i only used it as a demo.
It includes tables that are saved in json files. Contacts, Departments, Assignmentd, Data export and import (excel), Accessibility menu, and deletion logs.
Accessibility menu includes Theme Color (dark/light), Vision, Font Size, Dyslexia font and Simple Layout.
When files are imported they are automatically added in the tables unless they dont meet the requirements. If they dont, user gets an alert with info on what contact and what mistake he messed up.
